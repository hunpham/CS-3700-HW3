How to use server & client program:

Step 0: login to cs3700a and cd to the directory the server file is located

Step 1: run the server program on desired host using the command
(not needed if already compiled)
$ javac TCPMultiServer.java
$ java TCPMultiServer

There's a file called CS3700.htm as a default

Step 2: log in to cs3700b and cd to the directory the client file is located and
run the client program
$ javac TCPClient.java
$ java TCPClient

Step 3: follows the on screen instructions to use the client program

A new file with the same name will be created with 4 additional new line at the 
end should there is a 200 OK case

The default IP / hostname is the university cs3700a.msudenver.edu server 
running on port 5260 (you'd have to connect to the uni GP VPN to connect to this)

To quit the client, type "quit" when the program ask you to or press control-c
To quit the server, press control-c whenever you're done
